Pond slime is a problem in garden pools, algal blooms can produce toxins that incapacitate or kill animals and humans and even the term seaweed is pejorative — a weed being a plant growing in what humans consider to be the wrong place.
Positive aspects of algae are generally less newsworthy — they are the basis of marine food webs, supporting fisheries and charismatic marine megafauna from albatrosses to whales, as well as consuming carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.
Here we consider what algae are, their diversity in terms of evolutionary origin, size, shape and life cycles, and their role in the natural environment and in human affairs.
Frank Lloyd Wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career.
His commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death.
He had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.
Later in his life (and after his death in 1959), Wright was accorded significant honorary recognition for his lifetime achievements.
